# RAG_Based_AI_Agent
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that enables natural language querying of PDF documents. Users can upload PDFs through an intuitive Streamlit interface, then ask questions about their documents and receive AI-generated answers with proper source citations for transparency and verification.

The system leverages FastAPI with Inngest for robust workflow orchestration, Qdrant for vector storage, and OpenAI's embeddings and GPT models for semantic search and response generation. The architecture ensures efficient document processing, accurate retrieval, and contextual answer generation while maintaining source attribution throughout the pipeline.
